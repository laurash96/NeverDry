# Scheduler — Design Note

An analysis of **what the scheduler is for**, and of the gap between the
decisions the model already records and the behaviour that actually runs. It
complements `../design_domain_object_model.md` (the map of the domain classes),
`actuator-abstraction.md` (the layering question this one sits above) and
`flow-rate-provenance.md` (which flow rate answers which question).

**Status: Draft.** Open for comment. §14 tracks the questions this note raised:
**Q1–Q3 have working answers** (2026-08-21) and the sections above are written
to match them; **Q4-Q8 are open**, and they are what feedback is most wanted on.
Q8 is the newest and the most consequential for the interface: it asks whether a
zone should declare a time at all.
Nothing is binding while the note is `Draft` — a working answer is still a
proposal.
Lifecycle: `Draft → Proposed (open for comment, "RFC") → Accepted ("ADR")`.

Related: GH #74 (actuator abstraction and the unified-scheduler question —
primary discussion thread) and GH #95 (master pump). Throughout, a scheduled run
is taken not to consult the reactive threshold: the two modes answer different
questions, and the note says where that matters.

---

## 1. Why this note exists

`scheduler.py` today answers one question, per zone, in isolation: *may this
zone water right now?* The answer is binary — water, or skip with a reason.

That question turns out to be too small for three things users are asking for,
and for one the model already promises and does not deliver:

- **Rain delay.** `RainDelayPolicy` is written into the model but nothing reads
  it, and the forecast feed it depends on is never even read from Home
  Assistant. The integration promises a rain delay it cannot perform.
- **Time windows.** There is no way to say "never water between 09:00 and
  18:00" — a legal restriction in some regions, a tariff question in others,
  and an evaporation-loss question everywhere.
- **Cycle & soak.** `CycleSoakRule` is written into the model, has tests, and
  has no caller. Clay and slopes shed a 30-minute run; the same volume in
  3×10 minutes with soaks in between goes into the soil instead of the path.
- **Parallel runs.** Named as a policy, never constrained by hydraulics.

Each of these has been treated as a separate feature. They are not: they are
four faces of one question the scheduler does not currently ask —
**what is admissible right now?**

## 2. Where the scheduler is today

The nouns are largely present. The verbs are largely missing.

| Concept | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| `IrrigationMode` — MANUAL / REACTIVE / SCHEDULED | `zone.py:127` | **shipped**, wired at `controller.py:230` |
| `irrigation_time` (fixed start for SCHEDULED) | `zone.py:237` | **shipped** |
| `Scheduler.evaluate_scheduled` / `evaluate_reactive` | `scheduler.py:128,142` | **shipped**, called from `controller.py:394,408` |
| `Decision` / `Trigger` / `SkipReason` | `scheduler.py:64,92` | **shipped** |
| `ConcurrencyPolicy` SERIAL / PARALLEL | `scheduler.py:78` | static field; only `SERIAL` is reachable in practice |
| `Scheduler.next_eligible` | `scheduler.py:152` | written and tested — **no production caller** |
| `CycleSoakRule(max_segment_s, soak_s)` | `zone.py:150` | written and tested — **no production caller** |
| `RainDelayPolicy(enabled, probability_threshold, delay_hours)` | `environment.py:155` | written — **zero consumers anywhere** |
| `rain_probability_sensor`, `SensorKind.RAIN_PROBABILITY` | `environment.py:194,107` | binding declared — **never offered in the config flow, never read** |
| Irrigability windows | — | **do not exist** |
| Deferral state (how many times a zone was delayed) | — | **does not exist** |

Two entries deserve emphasis, because they change what this work is. Most of
it is not new design — it is **wiring model that was already agreed and
written**. And the rain delay is not an unimplemented idea: it is a feature the
domain model presents as part of the site's policy, with no path from the sky
to the decision.

## 3. Deferring is not skipping

The first correction this note proposes is to the shape of `Decision` itself.

Today a non-watering answer is a `SkipReason`. The four existing reasons —
`NOTHING_TO_REFILL`, `BELOW_THRESHOLD`, `ALREADY_RUNNING`, `THROTTLED` — share a
property that is easy to miss and load-bearing:

> **A skip is re-derivable.** Ask again in ten minutes with the same world and
> you get the same answer. No history is required to be correct.

A rain delay does not have that property. Asked twice with an identical world —
same deficit, same forecast, same hour — the *correct* answer differs depending
on **how many times the zone has already been deferred**. The first 90% forecast
should postpone; the fourth in a row, with the deficit still climbing, should
not.

That is why a delay cannot simply be a fifth `SkipReason`: `Decision` is
`frozen` and memoryless by construction, and adding a reason that silently
depends on unrecorded history would make the same value object mean two
different kinds of thing.

**Proposal — three outcomes instead of two:**

| Outcome | Meaning | Carries | Bounded? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GO` | Water now | `Trigger` | — |
| `DEFER` | *The need stands; not now* | `DelayReason`, `deferred_until`, `attempt` | **yes — must be** |
| `SKIP` | Nothing to do | `SkipReason` | no budget, no memory |

The distinction that matters operationally is the last column. **An unbounded
deferral is indistinguishable from a skip**, and its failure mode is silent: a
garden that never waters because the forecast said 90% five mornings running,
while the integration logs a reason that sounds reassuring every time. Bounding
the deferral is not a refinement of the feature — it is the thing that makes the
feature safe to ship.

## 4. The counter resets on satisfaction, not on rain

The obvious implementation is to ask, after the delay expires, *did it actually
rain?* That question is unnecessary, and asking it would create a second source
of truth about water that has already been accounted for.

**The deficit already knows.** If the rain arrives, `Zone.accumulate()` credits
it, the deficit falls below `threshold_mm`, and the zone leaves the deferral
chain by itself through `BELOW_THRESHOLD` — an ordinary skip. If the rain does
not arrive, evapotranspiration keeps running and the deficit keeps climbing,
which is exactly the pressure that should eventually override the delay.

So there is one rule, with no special case for rain:

> The deferral counter resets when the zone stops needing water — **however that
> happened**: forecast rain that arrived, a manual watering, a service reset.

This also settles where the counter lives. The scheduler is stateless by design
("*holds no state about the world*" — `scheduler.py:112`), and that property is
what makes its rules testable without a controller. The counter is state about a
*zone*, so it belongs on the `Zone` alongside `last_irrigated`, and it enters the
scheduler as an argument, exactly as `is_running` and `is_throttled` do today.

**It must survive a restart.** A counter held only in memory means every Home
Assistant restart silently refills the deferral budget — the same class of defect
as the restart gap already documented in `controller-reliability.md`, and just as
invisible from the logs.

## 5. Two independent brakes, not one

A count of deferrals is blind to both time and physics. Three deferrals of
twelve hours in August is not the same event as three deferrals of twelve hours
in late September, and no number of counted rinvii tells the plants apart.

Two brakes should act in parallel, either of which ends the deferral:

- **Budget** — `max_deferrals`, on `RainDelayPolicy` (Q3). The user-facing knob,
  easy to explain, easy to reason about.
- **Physical ceiling** — the deficit approaching `d_max`. Plants suffer from the
  deficit, not from a counter. Past that point the delay lapses **regardless of
  remaining budget**.

The second is the safety net, and the model already holds the right number to
express it: `d_max` is per-zone (soil type × root depth), so the ceiling is
per-zone too, which is correct — a shallow-rooted bed runs out of margin long
before a deep one under the same sky.

## 6. The delay predicate has three terms, not one

The motivating example — "90% chance of rain, so wait" — hides a problem.
**Probability is not quantity.** A 90% chance of 0.2 mm refills nothing, and a
delay decided on probability alone will postpone watering for drizzle, then
postpone again, spending the budget from §5 on rain that was never going to
matter.

The predicate that actually expresses the intent has three terms:

> **enough rain, likely enough, soon enough.**

| Term | Model support today |
|---|---|
| likely enough | `probability_threshold` (default 0.60) — **present** |
| enough rain | expected quantity, weighed against the zone's deficit — **absent** |
| soon enough | forecast horizon — **absent** |

On the third term there is a rule worth stating rather than configuring:
**the forecast horizon should equal `delay_hours`.** Look ahead exactly as far
as you intend to wait. If the plan is to postpone twelve hours, a high
probability at 48 hours is not a reason to postpone — it is a different
decision being smuggled in under the same number.

### 6.1 What Home Assistant actually supplies

Expected quantity is not a quantity NeverDry would have to derive: it is a
first-class field of Home Assistant's `Forecast` typed dict —
`native_precipitation` (`homeassistant/components/weather/__init__.py:190`) —
carried in **the same forecast entry** as `precipitation_probability`. One
`weather.get_forecasts` call returns both.

Every field except `datetime` is optional (`total=False`), so the design
question is not whether Home Assistant models the quantity, but **how many
integrations populate it**. Measured across the core integrations of HA
**2026.2.3**, counting the actual `Forecast` dict keys
(`ATTR_FORECAST_NATIVE_PRECIPITATION` / `ATTR_FORECAST_PRECIPITATION_PROBABILITY`
and their literal forms):

| Supplies | Integrations | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **Both** | `accuweather`, `aemet`, `buienradar`, `google_weather`, `met`, `tomorrowio`, `weatherkit` | 7 |
| **Quantity only** | `meteo_france`, `open_meteo`, `smhi` | 3 |
| **Probability only** | `environment_canada`, `ipma`, `metoffice`, `nws` | 4 |
| At least one | | **14** |

*Method: the counts match on the forecast keys themselves, not on the string
"precipitation" — a looser match inflates them by picking up
`_attr_native_precipitation_unit` (a unit declaration) and vendor API keys such
as AccuWeather's `PrecipitationProbabilityDay`. Core integrations only; custom
and HACS weather integrations were not measured.*

**Neither field can be required.** They are available in roughly equal measure —
10 against 11, overlapping in 7 — so demanding probability excludes
Météo-France, Open-Meteo and SMHI users, while demanding quantity excludes Met
Office, NWS and Environment Canada users.

### 6.2 The predicate degrades; it is not all-or-nothing

This corrects the framing above. Expected quantity is not an *extra term to
decide whether to include* — it is one of two interchangeable pieces of
evidence, and which one arrives depends on the user's weather integration. The
predicate should therefore degrade to what is actually supplied:

| Available | Predicate | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Both | enough rain, likely enough, soon enough | The intended behaviour |
| Quantity only | enough rain, soon enough | A forecast of 8 mm *is already* the claim that it will rain; probability adds nothing |
| Probability only | likely enough, soon enough | Today's design — defers on drizzle |
| Neither | rain delay unavailable | Must be said at configuration time, not discovered by a garden that never waters |

**The stakes are lower than they look**, and that is worth stating plainly
because it decides how much this may hold up a first version. §4 established
that the deficit self-corrects: if the forecast rain does not arrive,
evapotranspiration keeps running and the deficit climbs back. Quantity is
therefore not required for **correctness** — it is required to avoid **spending
a deferral from the §5 budget** on rain that was never going to refill anything.
It is an optimisation, and shipping without it is defensible *provided the
budget is bounded*. Without the bound, the drizzle case becomes unbounded
postponement and the optimisation turns load-bearing after all.

Which degradation modes ship first is open question **Q4**.

## 7. The forecast feed is not connected

This is the gap that makes the rain delay undeliverable today, and it is broken
in four places, not one.

1. **Config flow.** There is no field to bind the entity. The binding exists
   only in the pure model; a user has no way to supply it.
2. **Shape of the source.** `rain_probability_sensor: str | None` assumes a
   `sensor.*` entity. In Home Assistant, rain probability is most often an
   **attribute of a `weather.*` entity's forecast**, reachable through the
   `weather.get_forecasts` service — not a readable state. As declared, the
   binding likely has the wrong shape for the majority of installations. The
   measurement in §6.1 sharpens this: **both** pieces of evidence the predicate
   can use arrive from that one service call, so a `weather.*` binding gets the
   degradation of §6.2 for free, while a `sensor.*` binding needs two separate
   entities that, for most integrations, the user would have to build by hand
   with a template. See **Q5**.
3. **Units.** Home Assistant reports `precipitation_probability` as an
   **integer 0–100**. `probability_threshold` defaults to **0.60**, a fraction.
   Fed to `triggers_at()` unconverted, every forecast clears every threshold and
   the zone defers permanently. This is precisely the `flow_rate` L/min-vs-L/h
   defect the project has already been bitten by: it passes every unit test and
   only appears in the field. Normalise at the I/O boundary, per
   `unit-system.md`.
4. **Reader.** Nothing converts the state into a float, and nothing calls
   `RainDelayPolicy.triggers_at()`.

Point 3 is the one to design against deliberately. The rain delay fails *silently
towards not watering*, which is the direction a user notices last.

## 8. Serial or parallel is an admission decision

`ConcurrencyPolicy` is a static field today, and `allows_overlap` is consulted
as a fixed property of the installation. That is not sufficient for parallel
operation, because it answers only half the question.

> **The policy says *may I*. The hydraulics say *can I*.**

`PARALLEL` on its own is a promise the pipe cannot keep: one well, one pump, one
main. Admitting a zone to run concurrently requires three conditions, evaluated
**at the moment of admission** rather than once at startup — capacity is
consumed by whoever is already running:

1. the policy permits overlap;
2. `max_concurrent_zones` is not saturated;
3. the flow demanded by the active runs **plus the candidate** fits within the
   supply.

On the third, the precedence already established in `flow-rate-provenance.md`
applies unchanged: use the **historical measured** rate where one exists, the
design rate otherwise. And per that note's one-way-witness rule, a missing or
implausible flow figure should qualify the decision, never silently authorise
an overlap the supply cannot feed.

## 9. The irrigability envelope

This is the reframing the rest of the note depends on. The scheduler stops
answering *"should this zone water?"* and starts answering
**"what is admissible now?"**.

Admissibility has two site-level gates and one per-zone gate. They are different
in kind, and the difference decides how each is reported.

### 9.1 Time windows — declared

At **site level** (`Environment`) live the **irrigability windows**: the
intervals within which any run may begin. They exist for reasons that are all
site-wide and none of them per-zone — municipal restrictions, electricity or
water tariffs, wind, evaporation losses, and simply not soaking the lawn while
people are standing on it.

The windows are a **constraint**, not a schedule. They say when watering is
*permitted*, never when it *happens*. What happens inside them is still decided
by deficit, threshold and the rules above.

**The envelope wins over a zone's fixed hour** (Q1, resolved). A `SCHEDULED`
zone whose `irrigation_time` falls outside every window does not escape the
site's rules — see §14 Q1 for what happens to it instead. What a run that
*started* inside a window may do when the window closes under it is a **stated
Scheduler policy**, not a fixed rule: see §14 Q2.

### 9.2 The freeze interlock — observed

The second site gate is not declared by the user but **observed from the
world**: below roughly 5 °C, the valves must not be operated at all.

Three things distinguish it from a time window, and each one matters.

**It protects the hardware, not the plant.** Every other rule in this note asks
whether watering is *useful*. This one asks whether operating the valve is
*safe*: water left in a valve body or a line freezes and splits it. So the gate
suppresses **commands**, not merely irrigation — the active reachability probe
and the valve self-test are just as capable of cycling a valve into damage as a
scheduled run is. A freeze rule that only guarded irrigation would leave the two
paths that exist specifically to exercise the hardware wide open.

**It governs what NeverDry originates, and nothing else.** The interlock refuses
*NeverDry's own* commands — scheduled runs, reactive runs, service calls, and the
diagnostic paths above. It does **not** govern the user. A valve opened from
Zigbee2MQTT, from the Home Assistant entity directly, or by hand at the tap is
outside NeverDry's authority; what NeverDry does with such a run is **observe and
record it**, exactly as it does today (`controller.py:1801` settles a manual
session with `source="manual"` and fires `EVENT_IRRIGATION_COMPLETE`). No new
mechanism is needed for this, and none should be invented: blocking a person's
own action would claim an authority the integration deliberately does not have —
the same boundary `hardware-interface.md` already draws when it says NeverDry
consumes entities rather than owning hardware.

The reporting consequence follows from the same principle. A manual run during a
freeze is **recorded, not alarmed**: the user acted deliberately on their own
equipment, and NeverDry's part is to keep the books, not to second-guess them.

**5 °C is a margin, not a physical constant.** Water freezes at 0 °C; the
threshold sits above it because air temperature at a sensor is not the
temperature inside a valve body in the shade, and because the cost asymmetry is
extreme — a needless week without watering in February against a split valve.
The threshold should be configurable and the default should be argued as a
margin.

**The condition has memory, but the *decision* does not.** "Below 5 °C at some
point in the last 24 hours" is a statement about history, so it needs observed
daily minima rather than the current reading. Those are already observed:
`DiurnalRange` derives the daily extremes from the ordinary thermometer, which
is precisely why `temp_min_sensor` was withdrawn from the model (see the
struck-through row in `../design_domain_object_model.md`, §Environment). This
gate needs **no new tracker**.

**And it is a `SkipReason`, not a `DelayReason`** — which is worth stating,
because a freeze suppression looks superficially like the longest deferral
imaginable. Apply the §3 test: ask again in ten minutes with the same
temperature history and you get the same answer. It is **re-derivable**, so it
needs no memory and no budget. Three consequences follow immediately, and all
three are bugs if got wrong:

- a freeze must **not** consume the rain-delay budget of §5 — the two have
  nothing to do with each other, and spending the budget on winter would leave
  none for spring;
- a zone that does not water all winter is **correct**, not the silent
  never-waters failure §3 exists to prevent, so it must not be reported as one;
- the physical override of §5 — deficit approaching `d_max` lapses a delay —
  must **not** apply here. Overriding a freeze because the soil is dry is
  exactly the wrong trade: the plant survives thirst, the valve does not survive
  ice.

### 9.3 A removed valve — declared, per zone

The winter counterpart at zone level. During the shoulder seasons a user may
simply **unscrew the valve** and take it indoors, and NeverDry can no longer act
on that zone at all.

The right model for what happens next is **the houseplant treatment**: a zone
NeverDry never waters, whose need it reports so that a person can act. The
deficit stays real and stays visible, but it reads as **advice to water by
hand** rather than as a promise to water. That is the behaviour worth borrowing,
and it is the whole of what is borrowed.

What does *not* come with it is the physics. The zone is still outdoors — rain
still falls on it, outdoor evapotranspiration still describes its demand — so
the analogy governs **reporting and actuation, not the water balance**. Stated
in terms of the model: this is not `Placement.INDOOR`. That enum exists to
answer where the zone sits, and its two derived properties (`receives_rain`,
true only for `OUTDOOR`; `driven_by_outdoor_et`, true for `OUTDOOR` and `PATIO`)
would both flip to the wrong answer, silently stopping the rain credit on a bed
that is still getting rained on.

So it is a third property, independent of the other two, composed with
`placement` rather than replacing it. `Placement`'s own docstring already makes
exactly this argument for itself — "receives rain" and "is outdoors" are
independent, which is why the enum cannot collapse into a flag. **Is actuable**
is the third axis of the same argument, and the one the houseplant treatment
actually turns on.

Two connections this opens:

- **Reachability.** A valve that has been deliberately unscrewed must not raise
  the unreachable alarm — it is absent by intent, not silent by fault. Feeding
  a declared removal into the reachability layers is the difference between an
  accurate state and a winter of false alarms.
- **The deficit while suspended** — a narrower worry than it first appears.
  The instinct is that a whole winter of uncredited evapotranspiration pins the
  deficit at `d_max`, so the first spring run asks for an enormous volume. For
  an ordinary outdoor zone that does not happen, and the model is already what
  prevents it: winter evapotranspiration is a fraction of summer's, the seasonal
  Kc anchors compound the effect (winter values run 0.15–0.60 against summer's
  0.35–1.10), and winter rain normally exceeds the remainder. The deficit is
  clamped into `[0, d_max]` (`water_balance_model.py:150`), so an outdoor zone
  spends the winter resting on the zero floor rather than climbing.

  The residual case is the one that gets **no rain credit at all**:
  `receives_rain` is true only for `OUTDOOR`, so a `PATIO` or `GREENHOUSE` zone
  accumulates its demand with nothing on the credit side. There the deficit does
  climb during a long suspension, and a greenhouse — warmer, so a higher demand
  — is the worst of the two. Whether the deficit should be frozen for a suspended
  zone or allowed to clip as it does today is a water-balance question rather
  than a scheduling one, but the scheduler is where the consequence lands.
  See **Q7**.

  Snow is a third-order effect rather than a hole: a tipping-bucket gauge does
  not register it until it melts, so the credit side under-reads — but the demand
  side is near zero over frozen ground under snow cover, so the two mostly
  cancel, and the melt arrives as measurable rain.

## 10. Queued dispatch needs no queue

Within the envelope, each zone still chooses **how** it is dispatched — and the
model already has the enum for it. What changes is that both modes become
subject to the envelope:

- **REACTIVE — *queued*.** No fixed hour. The zone waters when it is in deficit
  *and* a window is open.
- **SCHEDULED — *at a fixed time*.** Starts at `irrigation_time`.

The word "queued" invites an objection, because the domain model states
plainly that `next_eligible` is *"deliberately **not** a queue: a queue has
memory of what is waiting, which is exactly the deferred design (GH #74)"*.

**That deferral is not being reversed.** Queued dispatch can be delivered with
zero memory: recompute at each tick, driest first. That is what `next_eligible`
already does.

And driest-first is **self-balancing**, which is the non-obvious part: watering
the driest zone lowers its deficit, so it stops winning. There is no starvation
to protect against, and therefore no fairness bookkeeping to store. The queue
stays virtual — an ordering, not a data structure.

This would also give `next_eligible` its first production caller.

Note the one place memory *is* genuinely required: the deferral counter of §4.
That is memory about a **zone**, held on the zone — not memory about a queue.
The scheduler stays stateless either way.

### 10.1 Three places a time can live, and the friction between them

A time can be declared in three places today, and they are not alternatives:
they are layers, and the layering is where the confusion sits.

| Where | What it means | Who it belongs to |
|---|---|---|
| Irrigability windows (§9.1) | when watering is *permitted* | the site |
| `irrigation_time` on a `SCHEDULED` zone | when *that zone* starts | the zone |
| no time at all (`REACTIVE`) | when the deficit asks, inside a window | the zone |

A reader setting up a garden meets all three and reasonably concludes that the
zone's hour is the real one and the rest is background. The field says
otherwise, and it said so within days of the windows being documented.

**The report that made this concrete.** Eleven zones, every one set to 05:00,
one watered (GH #270). The installation is doing exactly what it was told and
the result is indefensible.

Two separate things are wrong, and it is worth not conflating them, because one
is a missing feature and the other is a promise that cannot be kept.

**The missing part is the queue, and §10 already covers it.** Zones two through
eleven are not deferred at 05:00, they are *dropped*: the dispatch path returns
when something is already running, so nothing carries them forward. Driest-first
recomputation at each tick fixes that with no queue to store.

**The part no queue can fix is the hour itself.** Eleven zones sharing one pipe
cannot start at 05:00. Not "do not currently", *cannot*: one valve at a time is
the hydraulic constraint the whole serial policy exists to respect (§8). So a
per-zone fixed hour is accurate for the first zone and a fiction for the other
ten, and the fiction is the user's own configuration reflected back at them. The
interface offered a promise the domain cannot keep, eleven times, and the user
accepted it eleven times because nothing said otherwise.

**The resolution already exists, one layer up.** Q1 settled what happens when a
zone's hour falls outside every window: the run is **shifted, not suppressed** -
it starts *at or after* the configured hour, never before, and the user is told
the effective time. That decision quietly reclassified `irrigation_time` from a
**start** into a **lower bound**: not "water at 05:00" but "do not water before
05:00".

Contention between zones is the same shape of conflict as contention with a
window, so it takes the same answer: a zone's hour is the earliest moment it may
begin, and the scheduler starts it at the first admissible moment at or after
it. Eleven zones at 05:00 then means *"none of these before 05:00"*, which is
true, satisfiable, and very close to what the user meant. They run in sequence
from 05:00, ordered driest-first.

The consequence worth stating plainly: **`irrigation_time` stops being a
promise about when a run begins and becomes a constraint on when it may.** That
is a smaller thing than it appears - Q1 had already made it true for one class
of conflict - but it is a change in what the field means, so it must be said in
the interface, not only here.

## 11. Cycle & soak: two budgets on one run

`CycleSoakRule` is already placed correctly in the model, and the domain model
already argues why: infiltration rate, slope and soil type are properties of
that patch of ground, so the rule belongs to the `Zone`. The scheduler does not
own it — it **interposes** it.

Two consequences that are not yet written down anywhere.

**The number of segments is derived, not configured.** It follows from the
volume: `n = ceil(required_runtime / max_segment_s)`, where the runtime comes
from `water_demand_l` and the zone's flow rate. Asking the user for a segment
count would invite a fourth number that can disagree with the other three. This
is the same principle already accepted elsewhere in the project — what is being
waited for is a **volume**, not a time.

**A cycle-and-soak run has two different sizes**, and conflating them is the
mistake to avoid:

| Measure | Value | Budget it consumes |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupancy** | `n·segment + (n−1)·soak` | must fit the irrigability window (§9) |
| **Water** | `n·segment` | consumes hydraulic capacity (§8) |

A zone needing 3×10 minutes with 20-minute soaks occupies **70 minutes of wall
clock** while drawing water for **30**. Scheduling it against the wrong one of
those numbers either overruns the window or wastes two thirds of the supply.

From which the pleasing corollary: **during a soak the pipe is free.** Serial
operation plus cycle & soak becomes an interleaving problem naturally — the
scheduler can run another eligible zone in the gaps instead of standing idle.
This is the case where ordering finally earns its keep, and it needs no parallel
hydraulics at all.

What happens when the plan does not fit the window is the `overrun` policy of
§14 Q2. Under the default — truncation — the run is cut at a **segment
boundary**, never mid-segment: dropping whole segments leaves what was delivered
a valid cycle-and-soak pattern, whereas stopping halfway through a segment
leaves a partially infiltrated one and a soak that no longer has a purpose. The
undelivered remainder needs no bookkeeping of its own, because a
deficit-authoritative model already remembers it.

## 12. What the scheduler returns

Composing the above, the return value grows from a per-zone binary `Decision`
into a **plan for the moment**: which zones, in what order, serial or parallel,
with what pulse structure, inside which window.

```
Environment (site)   irrigability windows · RainDelayPolicy (threshold,
                     horizon, max_deferrals) · hydraulic capacity

```

Note that `placement` is already the right gate for "does this zone honour a
rain delay at all": a patio or indoor zone never saw the forecast rain, and
`RainDelayPolicy`'s docstring already says the site supplies the signal while
the zone decides whether to honour it. That seam needs no change.

## 13. What must not change

Whatever is built, one property is worth defending explicitly, because it is
easy to lose while adding clocks and counters:

> **The scheduler holds no state about the world.** Timers, counters and the
> current time enter as arguments.

That is what allows every rule above to be tested without a controller, a Home
Assistant instance, or a clock — and it is why the existing rules are testable
today. Any design that has the scheduler reading `dt_util.now()` or keeping its
own deferral map has given that up.

## 14. Questions and decisions

The questions this note raised, with the answers reached so far. **Q1–Q3 are
settled** (2026-08-21) and the sections above have been written to match; **Q6 is
settled in scope** but not in the form of its override (2026-08-24); **Q4, Q5, Q7
and Q8 are open**. Feedback on what remains open is what this note is circulated for.
The numbering is referenced from the sections above.

A settled answer here is still a *proposal* while the note is `Draft` — nothing
becomes binding until the whole note is promoted.

**Q1 — A fixed time outside every window: which wins? — Resolved 2026-08-21.**

**The site wins, and the zone is warned — not refused.**

The envelope is a site rule, and a zone cannot opt out of it: the reasons
windows exist (§9) are municipal restrictions, tariffs and evaporation, none of
which a zone is entitled to override. But an incompatible hour is a *warning*,
not a validation error, following the discipline already set in
`preset-and-override.md`: refusing to save traps the user, and the hour may be a
leftover from before the windows were configured.

Three consequences follow, and the first is the one that needed care.

**The run is shifted, not suppressed.** The zone starts at the first admissible
moment **at or after** its configured hour. It is tempting instead to let the
zone fall through to deficit-driven dispatch inside the next window, but that
would silently convert a scheduled zone into a reactive one — consulting the
threshold that a scheduled top-up deliberately ignores. Scheduled
semantics are preserved; only the start moves. *At or after* rather than
*nearest*, so a shifted run never waters **earlier** than the user asked.

**The warning must name the effective time**, not merely report that the hour is
invalid — again the `preset-and-override.md` rule, where the confirmation step
names each ignored value. `"14:00 is outside the irrigation windows; this zone
will start at 20:00"` is actionable. `"Invalid time"` is not. The shift can be
large — an hour of 09:00 against windows of 04:00–08:00 and 20:00–23:00 moves
the run from morning to night — which is exactly why the user has to be told
what they are getting.

**The check belongs to the config flow's existing plausibility guards**, not to
a new mechanism. `_unusual_zone_values()` (`config_flow.py:526`) already returns
human-readable warning lines for a zone, and it is wired to **two** call sites
that between them cover both moments this warning is needed:

- the **soft-confirm on save** (`config_flow.py:756` → `async_step_confirm_zone`),
  which catches the hour as the user sets it;
- the **on-demand audit** in the options menu (`async_step_check_zones`), whose
  stated purpose is *"installations configured before the guards existed"* —
  exactly the shape of a zone whose hour was valid until someone moved the site
  windows underneath it.

That second call site is what makes a config-time-only warning sufficient: a
zone orphaned by a later window edit is not silently lost, it surfaces the next
time the audit runs. No repair issue and no new notification path is required.

One change is implied: `_unusual_zone_values(zone, imperial)` is per-zone by
signature, and this check needs the **site's** windows as well. It has to take
the site context, which is the first guard that does. The message should keep
the existing idiom of that function — terse, naming the value and the bound:

> `irrigation time 14:00 outside watering windows — will start at 20:00`

Where the windows themselves are *set* is a separate placement question. They
are site policy, so they do not belong on the zone form; the options menu is the
natural home, alongside `model_params` rather than inside it — the windows are
not ET parameters.

**Q2 — May a run finish outside the window it started in? — Resolved 2026-08-21.**

**A stated Scheduler policy, not a fixed rule** — the same treatment
`ConcurrencyPolicy` already gets, and for the same reason: naming the policy
turns an emergent behaviour into a decision someone made.

| `WindowOverrunPolicy` | Behaviour | Suits |
|---|---|---|
| `GRACE` | A run may overrun by a bounded `grace_s` | Soft windows — tariff, evaporation, convenience |
| `TRUNCATE` *(proposed default)* | Cut at the window edge; the remainder stays in the deficit | Hard windows, and anything where watering *something* beats watering nothing |
| `FIT_OR_DEFER` | Admit only if the whole plan fits inside the window | Installations that want runs to be all-or-nothing |

The policy sits on the `Scheduler` beside `concurrency`, and `grace_s` is read
**only** when `GRACE` is selected — the dropdown decides, per
`preset-and-override.md`. Behind the other two the box is not used.

Three consequences the three-way choice does not settle on its own.

**Why `TRUNCATE` as the default.** It is the only one of the three that cannot
fail to water. `GRACE` breaks the site rule Q1 just established; `FIT_OR_DEFER`
can refuse a zone forever if its plan never fits any window — a zone that
silently never waters, which is precisely the failure mode §3 exists to prevent.
Truncation always delivers something, and the deficit carries what was missed
into the next window without any bookkeeping. It is the choice that degrades
rather than fails.

**`GRACE` is only safe because the setting is site-level.** A window can exist
for incompatible reasons — a municipal restriction, a tariff band, or
evaporation losses — and the model does not know which. Overrunning a tariff
window costs money; overrunning a legal one is a violation. The scheduler cannot
tell them apart, but the **site owner can**, and that is exactly whose setting
this is. One global choice is sufficient precisely because the rationale for the
windows lives at the same level as the policy. Marking individual windows hard
or soft would be the alternative, and is not worth the surface until someone has
both kinds.

**`FIT_OR_DEFER` needs a bound, like every other deferral.** The argument of §3
applies unchanged: a refusal that can repeat indefinitely is indistinguishable
from a skip. A plan that never fits should escalate rather than repeat silently
— either falling back to truncation once the deficit approaches the physical
ceiling of §5, or surfacing through the config-flow audit of Q1 as a zone whose
plan cannot fit its windows. The first is self-healing and needs no user action,
so it is the one to prefer; the second is worth having anyway, because a plan
that never fits is usually a misconfiguration, not a scheduling problem.

**Q3 — Where does `max_deferrals` live? — Resolved 2026-08-21.**

**Inside `RainDelayPolicy`**, beside `probability_threshold` and `delay_hours`.
The rain delay is one user-facing feature — *"if rain is ≥60% likely, postpone
up to 3 times, 12 h each"* — and splitting one feature's parameters across two
objects costs comprehension and buys nothing.

**This is not in tension with Q2**, which put `overrun` on the `Scheduler`. The
distinction is worth naming, because it generalises:

> A policy belongs with **the feature it qualifies**, not with the object that
> reads it.

`concurrency` and `overrun` qualify *scheduling itself* — they apply to every
zone and every run, whether or not a forecast feed exists. `max_deferrals`
qualifies *the rain delay*, and is meaningless without the threshold and horizon
that live next to it. The scheduler reads all four either way; **reading is not
owning**.

Two consequences.

**The limit and the counter live in different places, deliberately.**
`RainDelayPolicy` is `frozen` and holds no state: `max_deferrals` is a *bound*.
The count of deferrals actually spent is state about a zone and stays on the
`Zone` (§4). That separation is what lets the bound be changed by the user at
any time without invalidating a zone mid-deferral.

**The scheduler must be given the policy, not fetch it.** Honouring a delay
requires site policy that `evaluate_*` does not currently receive. Pass the
`RainDelayPolicy` itself as an argument rather than the whole `Environment`: the
scheduler has no business with entity bindings or yearly rain, and the narrower
argument keeps §13 intact — everything the scheduler needs still arrives as a
parameter.

**A note on the default.** The two numbers multiply. `max_deferrals = 3` with
`delay_hours = 12` is up to **36 hours** of postponement, which is a very
different proposition in July than in October. Whatever default is chosen should
be argued against the product, because that — total time without water — is the
quantity the user actually experiences. The count alone is not meaningful, and
neither is the interval alone.

**Q4 — Which degradation modes ship first?** *(Restated 2026-08-21. The original
question — "does the first version include expected quantity?" — assumed
quantity was an optional extra term. §6.1 shows it is not: it is one of two
interchangeable signals, and 3 core integrations supply it while supplying no
probability at all.)*

Supporting a single term strands one group of users or the other. Options:
ship **probability-only** first (today's model, smallest change, defers on
drizzle); ship **quantity-only** first (arguably the better signal, since a
forecast amount already asserts that it will rain); or ship the **full
degradation table** of §6.2 at once.

The *neither* row needs an answer regardless of which is chosen, because a rain
delay that is silently inert is exactly the failure mode of §3.

**Q5 — What shape is the forecast binding?**
`sensor.*` only, or also `weather.*` plus a horizon? The latter covers most real
installations (§7.2) but requires a service call rather than a state read, which
is a different integration pattern.

§6.1 argues this should be settled **before** Q4, because it largely settles it:
a `weather.*` binding receives probability and quantity from the same
`get_forecasts` call and can degrade per §6.2 at runtime, on whatever the user's
integration happens to supply. A `sensor.*` binding fixes the choice of term at
configuration time and, for most of the 14 integrations measured, requires a
template sensor the user has to write themselves.

**Q6 — What does the freeze interlock refuse, and can it be overridden?**
*(Raised and scoped 2026-08-24 with §9.2. Scope settled; the override's form is
the part still open.)*

**Settled — it refuses NeverDry's commands, not the user's actions.** The
interlock covers every command the integration originates, including the
diagnostic ones. Anything the user does directly — Zigbee2MQTT, the entity, the
tap — is observed and recorded, never blocked. §9.2 carries the reasoning and
the existing seam that implements the recording half.

**Open — the shape of the override.** The motivating case is real and
structural: an installation whose valves and drip lines genuinely do not suffer
below freezing, because the lines self-drain, the drip is subsurface, or the
hardware sits below the frost line. Such a user should not be held back by a
margin chosen for everyone else.

The proposed shape is a **system property** rather than a per-command
override, and the argument is the one Q2 already used for `WindowOverrunPolicy`:
the immunity is a property of the *installation*, and the site owner is the only
party who knows whether it holds. A per-command override would also fail in a
specific way — asked often enough, a safety prompt becomes a reflex, and a
warning that is always clicked through has stopped protecting anyone.

What remains genuinely undecided is its **form**, because the two obvious ones
each express something the other cannot:

- **A configurable threshold** captures *degrees* of tolerance — "fine down to
  −8 °C" — and adds no new concept, since §9.2 already argues the 5 °C default
  is a margin rather than a constant. But immunity that comes from *drainage*
  is not a temperature at all, and can only be expressed by picking an absurd
  value.
- **A declared system trait** ("self-draining lines", "subsurface drip")
  captures immunity honestly, but says nothing about the user who is merely
  tolerant to a lower temperature.

Supporting both is coherent — the threshold for degree, the trait for kind — at
the cost of two settings where users may expect one.

Whichever is chosen, the **wording decides whether it is answered correctly**. A
control that reads *"disable freeze protection"* invites the people who should
not touch it; one that reads as a fact about the installation is answered
accurately, because the user knows their own plumbing. This is the
`preset-and-override.md` discipline applied to a safety setting.

**Q7 — Should a suspended zone's deficit be frozen?** *(Raised 2026-08-24 with
§9.3.)*
Only zones with no rain credit — `PATIO` and `GREENHOUSE` — accumulate through a
long suspension, so the question is narrower than "what happens over winter".
Freezing the deficit for a suspended zone is honest about the fact that nobody
is measuring that soil; letting it clip at `d_max` is honest about the fact that
it really is drying. A third option is to keep accumulating but present the
number as advice rather than as a debt NeverDry intends to repay — which is what
§9.3 already argues the *alert* should do, and would keep the display and the
model saying the same thing.

**Q8 - Does a zone declare a time at all? - Open.** *(Raised 2026-09-26 by
GH #270: eleven zones at 05:00, one watered.)*

§10.1 reclassifies `irrigation_time` from a start into a lower bound, which
makes the eleven-zone case satisfiable. It does not answer whether the field
should exist, and that question is now worth asking, because three timing
mechanisms in one product is a lot to explain and the third one earns its place
only if it buys something the other two cannot.

**A - The site owns time; the zone declares none.** Windows at site level,
driest-first ordering inside them, and no per-zone hour. The eleven-zone garden
becomes one declaration instead of eleven, and no promise is made that the
hydraulics cannot keep.

*What it costs:* the only way to say *"the vegetable patch in the evening, the
lawn at dawn"* goes away. That is not an exotic want - shade, crop and foot
traffic differ across a garden - and a site window cannot express it.

**B - The zone keeps an hour, as a lower bound.** §10.1 as written.

*What it costs:* three mechanisms remain, and the field keeps a name that
describes what it used to do. Renaming it (*"not before"*) helps and does not
remove the need to understand all three.

**C - The zone declares a window, not an hour.** The zone's admissible interval
is intersected with the site's. One concept at two levels instead of two
concepts, and *"the patch in the evening"* becomes expressible without adding a
third mechanism. An empty intersection is a warning, exactly as Q1 already
prescribes for an hour outside every window.

*What it costs:* a migration from `irrigation_time`, and a form that asks for
two values where it asked for one.

**The criterion, stated so the decision is not made on taste.** A per-zone time
earns its keep only if a garden needs zones watered in *different parts of the
day*. If the real want is only *"not before dawn"* - one time for the whole
garden - then A is strictly better and the field is a liability. That is a
question about gardens, not about code, and the thread in GH #270 is where to
ask it: the reporter has eleven zones and a reason for the hour he chose.

Note that A and C both keep the vocabulary at one word, *window*, which is worth
something on its own: §10.1 exists because two words for two nearly-identical
things sent a user to configure eleven of the wrong one.

## 15. Consequences for the domain model

If this note is accepted, `../design_domain_object_model.md` needs revising in
these places — recorded here so the two documents do not drift:

- **`### Scheduler`, "Deliberately absent".** It currently defers *time windows,
  calendars, the queue, parallel runs and interleaving during soak* on the
  grounds that no concrete demand exists. §9–§11 argue the demand has arrived.
  The paragraph should be revised rather than deleted, and should record that
  the queue is still deferred (§10) even though queued dispatch is not.
- **`### Serial vs parallel irrigation: a Scheduler policy`.** Extend with the
  admission-control conditions of §8; the current text names the policy but not
  the hydraulic constraint that bounds it.
- **`### Cycle & soak: a Zone rule`.** Extend with the derived segment count and
  the occupancy/water distinction of §11. The placement argument itself stands.
- **`### Environment`, the `rain_probability_sensor` row.** Currently *"forecast
  feed behind the rain delay"*, which reads as though the feed were connected.
  §7 shows it is not, and §6.1/Q5 put the declared **shape** in doubt: the
  evidence the delay needs is a forecast entry, not a sensor state. Pending Q5,
  the row should at minimum stop implying a working feature. `RainDelayPolicy`
  also gains `max_deferrals` (Q3), and its row should record that the site owns
  the *bound* while the `Zone` owns the *count* (§4).
- **`### Scheduler`, member table.** Add the `overrun` policy (Q2) beside
  `concurrency`, and note that `Decision` now has three outcomes rather than
  two (§3) — the current row describes it as "water or skip".

There is also a stray table row (`interleave_during_soak()`) orphaned below the
Scheduler section's closing paragraph, detached from the table it belongs to.
