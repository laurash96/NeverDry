"""Unified valve-notifier subsystem.

Single API consumed by every subsystem that needs to surface a
condition to the user: valve operations (AI-029), flow-rate model
analysis (AI-040), indoor zone logic (AI-046), zone-health (AI-035).

The notifier sits on top of Home Assistant's ``persistent_notification``
service and adds two essential behaviours:

1. **Deduplication.** A second ``notify(zone, kind, ...)`` with the same
   context is a no-op. A second call with a *different* context updates
   the existing notification in place (HA's ``create`` with the same
   ``notification_id`` overwrites).
2. **Auto-clear.** ``clear(zone, kind)`` dismisses the notification once
   the condition resolves, so the user does not have to dismiss it
   manually.

Notification messages are built from per-kind templates formatted with
the ``context`` dict supplied by the caller.
