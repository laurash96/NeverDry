"""The integration's Python must not read translation files. This keeps it that way.

Localisation belongs to the two presentation surfaces and to nothing else: Home Assistant
resolves ``translations/<lang>.json`` for the backend GUI, and the card carries its own
dictionaries for the browser. Neither is the integration's business — the Python side deals
in identifiers (``estimated_flow``, ``req_open``, error codes) and hands them out; the text
is somebody else's problem, resolved later, in the user's language, in a layer that knows
what language that is.

That separation held everywhere until the notifications were localised, and the argument the
docstring above asked for was duly had. It has exactly one exception now, and the exception
is instructive rather than grudging.

``persistent_notification.create`` takes a finished title and a finished message. There is no
later layer: for a notification, the string handed over *is* the presentation, so "emit an
identifier and let somebody else resolve it" has nobody to name. Either the text is resolved
in Python or the notification reads ``stuck_open`` at the user. ``valve_notifier.py`` is
therefore allowed to resolve, and nothing else is.

The honest version of the rule the exception implies: a condition that wants to reach a person
*without* Python composing prose has to stop being a notification and become an entity, which
the user's own automation can act on in their own words. That is tracked separately, and it is
the direction of travel; until it arrives, the bell needs its words.

Worth recording how this was found, because it says something about the guard: it fired on a
*comment* that happened to name a translation file, not on the call that does the resolving.
The substring list below could not see ``async_get_translations`` at all, so the coupling it
exists to prevent would have walked straight past it. The detection is widened here to match
what the docstring always claimed to check.

``manifest.json`` is the one file production code legitimately reads (``__init__.py`` takes
the version from it) and it is not a translation file, so it is out of scope by construction
rather than by exception.
